Based on my review of the wireframes, here are the key assumptions made for this project:

## **Core Project Assumptions from Wireframes:**

### **1. Game Type Assumptions:**
- **Card Games Focus**: Specifically designed for "5 Cards, Secret 7, and custom game variants"
- **Manual Scoring**: All scores are entered manually (no automatic calculation from game rules)
- **Elimination-Based**: Games end when players reach a threshold, not time-based or round-limited

### **2. Player Assumptions:**
- **2-8 Players**: Recommended range, with minimum 2 players required
- **Persistent Names**: Players have consistent identities across games
- **Manual Management**: Players are added/removed manually, no automatic detection

### **3. Scoring Assumptions:**
- **Point Accumulation**: Higher scores are worse (elimination-based)
- **Default Threshold**: 100 points for elimination (adjustable to 200+)
- **Lowest Score Wins**: Automatic sorting by lowest score first
- **Round-Based**: Scores added per round, not continuous

### **4. Technical Assumptions:**
- **Mobile-First**: Primary use case is handheld devices during gameplay
- **20+ Rounds**: Must handle long games efficiently
- **Local Storage**: No cloud/server requirements mentioned
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection

### **5. User Experience Assumptions:**
- **Touch-First Interface**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback on score changes
- **Color-Coded Status**: Green→Yellow→Orange→Red→Black progression
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Modal (≤6 players) vs Full-screen (7+ players)

### **6. Data Assumptions:**
- **Auto-Save**: Every score update is automatically saved
- **Complete History**: All rounds stored for review and editing
- **Editable History**: Points can be modified after entry
- **No User Accounts**: Single-device, local data storage

### **7. Accessibility Assumptions:**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Full accessibility support required
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Alternative to touch input
- **High Contrast**: Visual accessibility support

### **8. Performance Assumptions:**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For handling large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Optimize for mobile performance
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Smooth UI updates during gameplay

## **Simplified First Release Assumptions (Based on Feedback):**
- **No Player Preferences**: Removed complex user customization
- **No Advanced Player Management**: Simplified to setup-only
- **No Complex Settings**: All configuration during game setup
- **Core Features Only**: Setup → Play → Score → History → End

These assumptions form the foundation for the technical architecture. Would you like me to proceed with creating a detailed technical implementation plan based on these assumptions?
