### Win Conditions for Each Player

| Player | Condition to Win                                          |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **A**  | A *shows* (wins last round → 0 points) **OR** A scores at most **1 point** in the last round (max 2 after doubling). |
| **B**  | B *shows* **AND** A scores at least **11 points** (22 after doubling) **AND** C scores at least **9 points** (18 after doubling) **AND** D scores at least **10 points** (20 after doubling). |
| **C**  | C *shows* **AND** A scores at least **3 points** (6 after doubling) **AND** D scores at least **2 points** (4 after doubling). |
| **D**  | D *shows* **AND** A scores at least **2 points** (4 after doubling). |

### Interpretation

- The player who wins the last round avoids adding points to their total, keeping their score low.  
- Other players gain points (doubled), increasing their totals.  
- For **B, C, and D to win**, the other players must accumulate enough points to push their totals above the winner’s total.  
- For **A to win**, A must either win the last round or keep last round points very low to maintain the lowest overall score.
