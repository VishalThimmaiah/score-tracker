- **Virtual scrolling** for long lists
- **Optimized images** and icons for different screen densities
- **Efficient animations** that don't impact performance

### 4. Accessibility Across Devices

- **Keyboard navigation** for desktop users
- **Screen reader compatibility** across all layouts

## Navigation Patterns by Device

2. **iPhone 14 Pro (393px)** - Common mobile size
3. **iPad (768px)** - Tablet reference
4. **MacBook Air (1440px)** - Desktop reference

### Orientation Testing
- **Portrait mode** - Primary for mobile
- **Landscape mode** - Secondary for mobile, primary for tablet
- **Rotation handling** - Smooth transitions between orientations

### Performance Testing
- **Load times** across different screen sizes
- **Scroll performance** with large datasets
- **Animation smoothness** on various devices
- **Memory usage** with complex layouts

This responsive design strategy ensures the game score tracking app provides an optimal experience across all devices while maintaining the core functionality and user experience defined in the wireframes.
