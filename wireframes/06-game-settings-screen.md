# Game Settings Screen Wireframe (NOT NEEDED AT ALL - GAME SETTINGS ARE ALREADY ADDED BEFORE THE GAME START)

## Summary

The entire Game Settings Screen has been marked as NOT NEEDED AT ALL for the first release. All game configuration is handled during the initial game setup phase.

## Rationale for Removal

Game settings are configured once during game setup and do not need to be changed mid-game. This simplification focuses on core gameplay functionality.

## Settings Moved to Game Setup Screen

All essential settings are now handled in the Game Setup Screen:
- **Game Name**: Set during initial setup
- **Game Type**: Selected from dropdown during setup
- **Elimination Threshold**: Configured with quick presets during setup
- **Player Management**: Add/remove players during setup only

## Features Removed for Simplification

### Removed Game Management Features:
- Mid-game rule changes
- Game reset functionality
- Save game templates
- Export game data
- Advanced gameplay options

### Removed App Preferences:
- Theme selection (will use system default)
- Sound effects
- Notifications
- Complex display options

### Removed Data Management:
- Storage usage monitoring
- Backup and sync options
- Import/export functionality
- Privacy and security settings

### Removed Advanced Features:
- Custom game rules setup
- Accessibility settings (basic accessibility built-in)
- Notification preferences
- About and help sections

## Auto-Save Implementation

The one critical setting that remains is auto-save functionality, which is now:
- **Always enabled** by default
- **Saves on every score update** automatically
- **No user configuration needed**

This ensures data persistence without requiring user interaction or settings management.

## Integration with Simplified App

Settings functionality is now distributed across:
- **Game Setup Screen**: All game configuration
- **Main Dashboard**: Core gameplay with automatic data persistence
- **Score Entry**: Automatic save on every update

This approach eliminates the need for a dedicated settings screen while maintaining all essential functionality for the first release.
